# What is it?

Idea behind this demo project was to check how we could avoid boilerplate code on writing integration with external APIs.

If you have an external service that provides documentation in OpenAPI 3.x format, we could use it to generate API client (with support types).

Here we have some Django app (e.g. `demoapp`). That serves openapi schema (yaml) with help of [drf-spectacular](https://github.com/tfranzel/drf-spectacular) on `http://localhost:8000/openapi/`.

To generate API client I used [openapi-python-client](https://github.com/openapi-generators/openapi-python-client).

`$ openapi-python-client generate --url http://localhost:8000/openapi/`

It created `demo-api-client` folder, which API client that could be used as dependency and shared for consumers.

In case you use `pip`, just build wheel and install in dev environment.

`poetry build -f wheel`

`pip install demo-api-client/dist/*.whl`

And now you could work with autogenerated models and endpoints (see readme in `demo-api-client` for more examples).

```python
from demo_api_client import Client
from demo_api_client.api.api import api_v1_books_list as get_all_books
from demo_api_client.models import PaginatedBookList

client = Client(base_url="http://localhost:8000")

with client as client:
    books: PaginatedBookList | None = get_all_books.sync(client=client)
    print(books)
```
